## Onboarding Your First Code Package

The use-case will be a secure portal, a utility used for displaying enriched accounting data that is:

- secure

- has SLAs

- transforms between various web-based accounting APIs

- applies a data-driven processing pipeline in realtime to enrich data showing up in the API

- can be deployed to multiple sites (edge and cloud)

The Use-case is depicted here:

## Application Resources

Please download the ZIP file from here:

http://99.252.137.208:8045/EWebScenario-AppManagerIntro-Resources.zip

And unzip to a local directory.

It contains the basic files which will be used in the next step to onboard your package.


## Domain Model

As onboarding involves mapping the contents of your package (utility, function, etc.) to a domain model, we have made that accessible within the application.

Use the `Configure` tab at the bottom of the portal - then the `Domain Model` tab to inspect the entities and relationships which will be captured during onboarding.
