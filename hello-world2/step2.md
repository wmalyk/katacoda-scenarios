## Creating your First Cloud Service

The eventual use-case will be a secure portal for displaying enriched accounting data that is:

- secure

- has SLAs

- transforms between various web-based accounting APIs

- applies a data-driven processing pipeline in realtime to enrich data showing up in the API.

The Use-case is depicted here:

http://99.252.137.208:8075/UseCase.pdf

We will launch a portal at:  http://malyk.net (note, it will not be accessible till later in the scenario)


## Application Resources

In the previous scenario, we created a code package to be used for the Secure Web Portal. Here we will utilize a pre-built version of the same.
